- Verify admin has created trips

- This happens when the auth token expires
- Simply log in again to continue
- User data is preserved in localStorage

**3. Cannot create admin account:**
- An admin already exists in the system
- Only one admin account is allowed
- Contact the existing admin for access

**4. WebSocket connection issues:**
- Check that backend is running on port 8000
- Look for WebSocket errors in console
- Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
